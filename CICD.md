# CI/CD team philosophy

We believe in continuous integration and deployment in order to deliver quality code quicker.

System process and configuration of product organization for repository, hosting, and deployment:
GitHub is being used for the repository. Will be hosted on the Apple App Store via Firebase by setting up a Firebase
project which utilizes Firestore (the database) and Authentication (for signing-in).
Will be deployed using Firebase as well.
