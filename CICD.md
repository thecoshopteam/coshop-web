# Our CI/CD Team Philosophy

We believe in continuous integration and deployment in order to deliver quality code quicker.

## System process and configuration of product organization for repository, hosting, and deployment

- GitHub is being used for the repository
- Vercel is being used to host and deploy the web app
- Firebase is being used as our backend, utilizing Firestore (the database) and Authentication (for signing-in).
